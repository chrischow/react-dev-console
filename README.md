# react-dev-console
A simple React app to bring the developer tools console into the browser.

## Impetus
The IT environment I work with is **absolute dog shit** for web development. Chrome and Edge are available, but developer tools are disabled due to "SeCuRiTy". The only browser with developer tools available is IE11, which may even be decommissioned. Hence, to enable development work to continue, I developed react-dev-console for troubleshooting JS functions in the browser.
